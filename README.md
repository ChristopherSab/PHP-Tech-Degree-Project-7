# PHP Techdegree Project 7 - Todo API with Laravel

In this project, I created a REST API using Laravel. The API provides a way for users to manage data in the API: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of todos, todos by id, as well as adding, updating and deleting todo items in the database.
